## Preface
I used my search history to map every page, website and source containing d3. Sometimes I wrote down the exact search query and sometimes I rephrased it to make sure it is a bit more understandable.

## Stack-overflow
While working on the different assignments for frontend 3 I came across a lot of errors which I couldn't solve. So in order to understand these errors I searched for the answers on the internet. Below you'll find a list of every stack-overflow page I visited trying to find out what I did wrong when something wasn't working.

## Tutorials
Just reading about issues other people have had before me didn't really help me grasp the concept of d3. For me following tutorials and seeing someone do the thing I want to do is the best way to learn.
